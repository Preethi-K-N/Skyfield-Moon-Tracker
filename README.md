A comprehensive, high-precision command-line tool for calculating and visualizing the phase of the Moon for any given date. This project uses the powerful **Skyfield** astronomical library to ensure calculations are based on the professional-grade JPL DE421 ephemeris.

The script generates a detailed multi-panel analysis image, a summary text file, and attempts to download an actual NASA photograph of the Moon for the specified day, saving everything into a neatly organized, date-stamped folder.

## Key Features âœ¨

* **High-Precision Calculation:** Utilizes the Skyfield library for accurate positional astronomy, calculating illumination, elongation, and moon age.
* **Comprehensive Visualization:** Generates a 4-panel chart using Matplotlib, showing:
    1.  A visual representation of the Moon's phase.
    2.  The Moon's position in its orbit around the Earth.
    3.  The current day's position on a synodic month timeline.
    4.  A detailed information panel with key data points.
* **NASA Image Fetcher:** Attempts to download the real Moon image for the given day from NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio.
* **Organized Output:** Creates a new folder for each requested date (e.g., `2025-09-07_Sunday`) to keep all generated files tidy.
* **Detailed Info File:** Produces a `.txt` file with all calculated data, including illumination percentage, moon age, elongation angle, and estimated times for the next major phases.

## Installation

To get this project running locally, follow these steps.

**1. Prerequisites**
* Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed.

**2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Skyfield-Moon-Tracker.git](https://github.com/your-username/Skyfield-Moon-Tracker.git)
cd Skyfield-Moon-Tracker
```

**3. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**4. Install Dependencies**
First, create a `requirements.txt` file in the project directory with the following content:

```txt
skyfield
numpy
matplotlib
requests
```

Then, install the packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The first time you run the script, Skyfield will automatically download the required ephemeris file (`de421.bsp`), which is about 17 MB.

## How to Use ðŸš€

Running the tool is simple.

1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  Execute the Python script:
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
    *(Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your file).*

3.  When prompted, enter a date in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
    ```
    Enter date (YYYY-MM-DD) or 'quit': 2025-09-07
    ```

4.  The script will process the data and save the output files inside the `generated_images` folder, under a sub-folder named with the date you provided (e.g., `generated_images/2025-09-07_Sunday/`).

## How It Works

This tool's accuracy comes from the **Skyfield** library, which computes the positions of celestial bodies using a Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Development Ephemeris.

1.  **Position Calculation:** It calculates the apparent geocentric positions of the Sun and Moon for the user-specified date.
2.  **Elongation & Illumination:** The angular separation (elongation) between the Sun and Moon as seen from Earth is determined. This angle is the key to the Moon's phase and is used in the formula $`k = \frac{1 + \cos(i)}{2}`$ to find the illuminated fraction.
3.  **Visualization:** Matplotlib is used to draw the phase, orbital diagram, and data panels by translating the calculated astronomical data into graphical elements.
